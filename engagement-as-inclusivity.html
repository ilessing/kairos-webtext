      <p class="body-text-columns">Each fall quarter, the College of Creative Studies invites colleagues from the Writing Program to speak to their Writing &amp; Literature majors about Writing Studies as a discipline comprising multiple subdisciplines. Kenny and I are frequently paired as speakers to introduce our respective research projects in science communication, as well as to answer students’ questions about courses, the best books to read (yes, these are student-authors who love books!), and career pathways. Our talks occur in the Old Little Theatre, on a modest stage swathed in black curtains and accessorized with chairs that euphemistically might be called “shabby chic.” Each fall, as I tell shadowy forms in dimly lit theater seats about my backstory, I am reminded of the field’s reliance on public presentations and the challenges they bring. <br>‍<br>My backstory starts with an abundance of STEM-related childhood memories. As an Air Force brat, I was born into an environment saturated with advanced science and technology: secure walkie-talkies known as “bricks” for their weight and size, which my father carried daily; flightlines, ICBM missile silos, and the Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC 6, “Slick Six”), which were at different times under his command; and computers with daisy-wheel printers on which my sister and I lost <em>Star Trek</em> games to a mainframe computer (see Boyd, Hawisher, Lunsford et al., 2004 for a more detailed technology literacy narrative). My mother was a physical therapist who maintained her license even as we moved every two years or so, and who countered the initial squeamishness of her daughters towards high school biology dissections by calmly talking about the cadaver she had worked on during her own medical education. She also passed along a love of embroidery, especially pieces featuring nature subjects. As a family, we were birdwatchers, amateur astronomers, photographers, aquarium hobbyists, and participants in conservation efforts.   <br>‍<br>From this childhood, I went to a small liberal arts college initially thinking that I might major in biology. However, I was interested in English literature. And the history and philosophy of science. And languages. And computers. And music. I ended up earning an English major plus three minors. My biology professors and peers teased me with their predictions that I would go on to write articles in Spanish for <em>Scientific American</em> and to speak at NSF-sponsored conferences. Little did I know then how close they came to identifying my eventual career path (after detours) of becoming a Writing professor who teaches science communication. </p>

        <p class="body-text-no-columns-no-padding">One reason why my college self was insecure about which future path I should take was that,<br> like so many young adults, I was wary of professions that required public speaking. <br>Terribly self-conscious as a student, I found my hands sweating, my voice shaking, <br>and my throat tightening when I became the center of attention at the front of <br>a room. At the time, the convention for presentations on English literature <br>was to read a paper out loud to an audience, which was even more intolerable. <br>After all, I read my essay drafts out loud to myself in private to catch errors, <br>and it was that internal editor I heard when I read into a microphone. <br>My English professors advised me to “power through” the nervousness, and<br> that time and practice would resolve the issues. I spent years of graduate<br> school powering through presentations using overhead projectors, then <br>powerpoint, then small video cameras. When my Writing Studies professors <br>freed me from my assumptions that presentations must be memorized or read, I <br>finally started to find my way. Nonetheless, it wasn’t until I started teaching regularly <br>and seeing the real size of audiences at conference panels that I began to feel more comfortable.<br><br>As a professor at UCSB, I’ve frequently met students who have serious difficulties with public speaking, similar to those I had in college. For instance, upon receiving my final assignment to give a speech on her course project, one student came to my office hours, burst into tears, and panicked for fifteen minutes. Another student informed me after his first ever presentation that he had been so nervous, he had chugged a couple of beers just before my class. The COVID-19 pandemic, with its extreme social isolation as countries went into lockdown mode, has amplified the distress that students feel when called upon to speak publicly. In the past couple of years, I’ve encountered more and more students with documented accommodations for social anxiety. </p>

      <p class="body-text-columns">At the same time, I’ve frequently heard colleagues across the campus assert, with undertones of tough love, that students must be taught public speaking skills. Too often, though, “public speaking” continues to be equated to academic lecturing, with a sage on the stage working through slide decks. In other parts of the campus, “public speaking” seems limited to business connotations such as pitching proposals or giving reports to teams and stakeholders. As Boromisza-Habashi et al. (2015) have argued, these representations of public speaking form an Anglo-American cultural ideal that ignores other cultural models of public speaking. The “standard” conventions signal a particular cultural identity, just as adherence to a strict cultural ideal of academic punctuation and word usage do, and they can be heavily policed. Consider, for example, the practice of having students count the number of “ums” when a peer presents their findings from a research project. The much younger educator in me pleads guilty to encouraging such policing.<br>‍<br>Now, as I write this webtext, I find myself reflecting on two shifts regarding education that Writing Studies professionals have supported. The first recognizes that accommodations for mental health issues can and should be made. During college and graduate school, my professors never considered the nervous responses I had to public speaking to be phenomena pointing to a condition that health professionals could help address. Rather, like writer’s block, my responses were framed as a condition to be overcome through self will, discipline, and practice. Today, as several scholars in Disability Studies (e.g., Angharad Butler-Rees, 2021; Jennifer Leigh &amp; Nicole Brown, 2020) have argued, this internalized perfectionism among academics in neoliberal institutions is as unhealthy as it is unrealistic. The second shift is the broad recognition that current-traditional pedagogies, with rigidly defined conventions, are used to tacitly and explicitly exclude those who do not match a certain cultural ideal. Students today expect more inclusive pedagogical approaches from their instructors.<br><br>Fortunately, more malleable models for public presentations are readily available, especially in science communication. To be sure, science communicators may use sage-on-stage approaches, but, because of the emphasis on both <em>teaching </em>and <em>engaging</em> multiple possible audiences, they often choose interactive and out-of-the-box approaches. Science communicators are choreographers of experiences as much as they are speakers, as they encourage audience members to become invested in and to contribute to the topic at hand. Or perhaps I should say <em>in</em> hand. As just one example of how experiences may be choreographed, science communicators may ask audience members to participate in a conversation by using their hands. They encourage audience members: <br>‍<br> • to handle props (e.g., “If the earth were represented by a basketball, and the moon, a tennis ball, how far apart would you need to hold them to accurately represent the distance between the earth and the moon?” Derek Muller, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz9D6xba9Og">Veritasium</a>);<br><br> • to use parts of their hands as readily available scales of measurement (e.g., “North America’s smallest butterfly, the Western pygmy blue, has a wingspan the size of your smallest fingernail.”);<br>‍<br> • to more safely waft scents towards the nose so that they can be recognized (e.g., “Do not deeply inhale that unknown gas.”); and<br>‍<br> • to feel textures (e.g., “Stroke your fingers down the arms of this seastar.”).</p>

      <p class="body-text-columns">Science communicators choreograph experiences using the other senses, too, as well as physical motion, such as asking audiences to form groups or to move from one side of a room to another. <br>‍<br>Such interactive techniques are typically associated with informal learning spaces, such as museums, zoos, and nature centers, where docents are stationed around the area to encourage visitors to participate in one-to-one or small group activities. However, given the limitations of the sage-on-stage model, these techniques merit more use in formal learning spaces as well. When presentations are redefined as communicators choreographing experiences to which audience members contribute their own knowledge, then the dynamics are changed. Audience members become more explicitly responsible for deciding how they will respond to such invitations to engage with the presentation, as well as what they will share and learn.   <br>‍<br>As faculty members, if we define a broader range of presentation techniques as legitimate in academic spaces, then we open more possibilities for student success. I came to this realization while working with the student who had panicked in my office to reach an accommodation. She and I discussed multiple options, during which she determined that she most feared extended speaking in front of the class. A few sentences would be fine. To conduct her presentation, then, she researched and then created stations with different activities for her peers to perform individually and in groups. At the start of the presentation, in 2-3 sentences, she instructed her peers to circulate among the stations for 10 minutes and to be prepared for a 5-minute conversation about their experiences. In all, the audience members did the bulk of the talking. To enable this conversation, though, the student had done quite a bit of work behind the scenes: trying out different possible activities, gathering supplies, writing out instructions, and setting up the stations. Ultimately, the class voted her presentation to be among the best and most enjoyable of the quarter.    <br>‍<br>Since that time, I have taken advantage of the curb-cut effect. Just as curb cuts in sidewalks were first ordered as an accommodation and became valued by a much larger constituency than people using wheelchairs, allowing a broad range of presentation techniques empowers all students to play to their strengths. In the last five years students have presented topics by: including digital surveys as they talk; interacting live with presentations they have recorded in advance; asking audience members to carry out brief experiments at their desks, whether analog (e.g., identifying plant specimens) or digital (e.g., analyzing visual illusions online); and, of course, by speaking with a slide deck. What has surprised me most is how well students are able to present humanities topics in the same way, as when one student involved in preserving an indigenous language set up stations around the classroom to explain not just a vocabulary word, but also the connotations it has in different contexts. <br><br>Perhaps most important, incorporating science communication techniques within courses helps shift the attitudes towards giving presentations from fearful to fun. If I had had these options during college, I would not have had to “power through” public speaking to gain the confidence to converse with students from an old theater stage. I would have been able to develop confidence at my own pace, while better including my audience members in a more enjoyable experience.</p>
